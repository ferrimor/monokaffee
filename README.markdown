How to Use
----------
First retrieve the Monokaffee theme. This can be done a couple of ways.

Download the source in .zip or .tgz format using the [download button](#download_button) **or** clone this project to your computer using git:

	git clone git://github.com/mthjones/monokaffee.git

Then move or link it to the Espresso themes folder (note that you may need to create the folder first):

	mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Themes/
	
	mv Monokaffee.foam ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Themes/
	-- or --
	ln -s Monokaffee.foam ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Themes/

More Information
----------------
This theme is based on the conventions outlined by [elliottcable][] in his [Espresso Sugar Standard][ess]. Due to the fact that this standard is not set in stone and being followed by every sugar developer yet, this theme may not work superbly with certain sugars, although it will be extended with additional sugar support in the future.
